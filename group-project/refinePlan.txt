Refined Plan

Retailer Object:

1. Stores location of seller
2. Stores availability of seller
3. contact info
4. type of vehicle aka capacity
5. range of mobility
6. price
	a. establish different types of pricing, ie by the hour/ distance etc
	
Interface:

Calendar, probably use google maps

	-user input for starting and ending position

	-select a day or range from map, will then query database for retailers available
	during that time, will then use ajax to place retailers in list
	
	-We'll use the google maps api to calculate whether a user is within range
