<a name="General"></a><h1>General</h1>
<p>There will always be something I forget, but hopefully this is pretty comprehensive. This page splits everything up by general body part, but keep in mind that it need not be implemented as such. In other words, for example, don't feel obligated to train biceps and triceps on the same day just because they both fall under the "arms" category. For reference, this was the (6-day) split we did together.</p>

<p>Try to pick weights that allow you to do sets of 8-12 repititions for a total of 3 sets per exercise. If you only get 8 reps on your first set and you know there's no way in hell you'll get that much on your second set, don't hesitate to drop to a more appropriate weight. At the same time, though, pushing yourself within reason is healthy.</p>
<p>One last thing: diet. There are millions of people out there all claiming to be experts, each with his or her own philosophy on food. Honestly, I think it really depends on the person in question. However, you can be certain that if you don't eat more than usual, you'll see very little bodily change. Your body can't create something out of nothing, so if you don't feed it extra food it won't be able to add much muscle. At best, you might see longterm, slow recomposition while maintaining roughly the same body weight. Obviously, this doesn't mean you need to eat a pint of ice cream every day. It simply means you may want to consider a couple more forkfulls here and there.</p>
<a name="Shoulders"></a><h1>Shoulders</h1>
<p>I like to pair body parts that don't interfere much with each other, which is why shoulders and legs are alright on the same day. Generally, I do four exercises for shoulders: barbell overhead press, seated dumbbell shoulder press, front raises, and lateral raises.</p>

<a name="Chest"></a><h1>Chest</h1>
<p>The chest routine is similar in nature to shoulders in the sense that its exercises attack from all different angles. I tend to do only three exercises for chest: barbell flat bench, seated dumbbell incline press, and flyes.</p>

<a name="Back"></a><h1>Back</h1>
<p>Back exercises tend to recruit biceps as a secondary, which is why I think it goes well on the same day as chest (since chest recruits triceps, so there is still little overlap). For back, I usually do three exercises: pull-ups, seated cable rows, and reverse flyes.</p>

<a name="Arms"></a><h1>Arms</h1>
<p>For convenience, I've lumped biceps and triceps here into one umbrella category. Because they are so easily isolated, however, it is easy to split them up and work them on different days. This is what I choose to do, and I like to do three exercises for each. For biceps I do barbell curls, preacher ez-bar curls, and dumbbell hammer curls, and for triceps I do one-arm cable tricep extensions, skullcrushers, and triangle cable tricep extensions (I replaced dips because they seemed uncomfortable).</p>

<a name="Abs"></a><h1>Abs</h1>
<p>Abs aren't fun, but nobody gets a good six-pack with cardio alone. Lots of perfectly good ab exercises exist out there, but at Global I would say it's probably easiest to pick these three: ab crunch machine, leg raises, and incline sit-ups.</p>

<a name="Legs"></a><h1>Legs</h1>
<p>Last but not least, legs. There are three major muscle groups in your legs: quadriceps, hamstrings, and calves. Accordingly, we have three exercises: leg extension machine, leg curl machine, and calf raises.</p>
